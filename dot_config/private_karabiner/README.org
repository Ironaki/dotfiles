** [[./karabiner.json]]
- Main configuration file
- Karabiner-Elements watches =~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json= and reloads it if updated.
- *Sync between devices are possible, but make sure the vendor_id and product_id are correct*
E.g.
| Device Name                          | vendor_id | product_id |
|--------------------------------------+-----------+------------|
| Macbook Pro 13' without touchbar kbd |      1452 |        630 |
| Macbook Pro 15' with touchbar kbd    |      1452 |        632 |
To make the configuration file work for both of the keyboard above.
Two separated configurations are needed in the json file, even if the only difference between these two is the product_id
